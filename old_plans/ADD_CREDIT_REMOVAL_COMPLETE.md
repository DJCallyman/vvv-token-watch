## Overview

Successfully removed the "Add Credit" section from the Venice AI Dashboard as requested. This included both the compact top-up button in the hero balance card and the full top-up widget in the balance tab.

## What Was Removed

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Balance Widget (`enhanced_balance_widget.py`)

**Removed Components:**
- ‚ùå Import: `from .topup_widget import create_compact_topup_button`
- ‚ùå Signal: `topup_requested = Signal(str, float)`
- ‚ùå UI Element: Compact top-up button in bottom row of hero card
- ‚ùå Method: `show_topup_options()` method

**Result:** Hero balance card now shows only usage trend indicator without any top-up CTA

### ‚úÖ Combined App (`combined_app.py`)

**Removed Components:**
- ‚ùå Import: `from vvv_token_watch.topup_widget import TopUpWidget`
- ‚ùå Widget Creation: Full top-up widget in balance tab
