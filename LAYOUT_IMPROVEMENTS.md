# Chart Layout Improvements - Space Optimization

## Problem Identified
The Analytics tab was cramped with charts appearing "squashed":
- Charts were set to 6x3 inches - too small for detailed visualization
- No scroll area meant everything had to fit in fixed window size
- Horizontal layout compressed charts even further
- Model names and labels were overlapping

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Increased Chart Dimensions**
```python
# Before:
self.usage_chart = ChartCanvas(self, width=6, height=3, dpi=100)
self.cost_chart = ChartCanvas(self, width=6, height=3, dpi=100)

# After:
self.usage_chart = ChartCanvas(self, width=10, height=6, dpi=100)
self.usage_chart.setMinimumHeight(450)  # Ensure minimum height

self.cost_chart = ChartCanvas(self, width=10, height=5, dpi=100)
self.cost_chart.setMinimumHeight(400)
```

**Impact:**
- Usage chart: 6x3 → 10x6 inches (3.3x larger area)
- Cost chart: 6x3 → 10x5 inches (2.8x larger area)
- Minimum heights enforce readable display

### 2. **Added Scroll Area**
```python
# Wrapped content in QScrollArea
scroll_area = QScrollArea()
scroll_area.setWidgetResizable(True)
scroll_area.setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy(Qt.ScrollBarAsNeeded)
scroll_area.setVerticalScrollBarPolicy(Qt.ScrollBarAsNeeded)
```

**Benefits:**
- Charts can use their full size without being compressed
- User can scroll to see all content comfortably
- No more forced fitting into fixed window size
- Better UX for different screen sizes

### 3. **Optimized Chart Spacing**
```python
# Usage chart (2 subplots):
self.usage_chart.fig.subplots_adjust(
    left=0.08,   # More room for y-axis labels
    right=0.98,  # Use full width
    top=0.92,    # Room for title
    bottom=0.15, # Room for rotated x-axis labels
    hspace=0.35  # Vertical space between subplots
)

# Cost chart (pie + legend):
self.cost_chart.fig.subplots_adjust(
    left=0.05,   # Minimal left margin
    right=0.72,  # Room for legend on right
    top=0.92,    # Room for title
    bottom=0.08  # Minimal bottom margin
)
```

**Improvements:**
- Better use of available canvas space
- More room for rotated x-axis labels (model names)
- Legend has proper spacing without overlap
- Titles don't get cut off

### 4. **Maintained Responsive Layout**
- Left panel (charts): Takes 70% of width
- Right panel (metrics/recommendations): Takes 30% of width
- Both panels scroll independently if needed

## Visual Comparison

### Before:
- ❌ Charts: 6"×3" - cramped and hard to read
- ❌ Fixed height - everything squeezed to fit
- ❌ Model names overlapping
- ❌ Legend text cutting off
- ❌ No way to see more detail

### After:
- ✅ Charts: 10"×6" and 10"×5" - spacious and readable
- ✅ Scrollable - charts use optimal size
- ✅ Model names clearly visible with rotation
- ✅ Legend properly positioned with full text
- ✅ Professional appearance with room to breathe

## Files Modified
- `model_comparison.py`:
  - `init_analytics_tab()` - Added scroll area wrapper
  - Chart canvas sizes increased significantly
  - `render_usage_chart()` - Updated subplot spacing
  - `render_cost_chart()` - Updated layout margins

## Testing Recommendations
1. Open Analytics tab
2. Verify charts are larger and more readable
3. Test scroll functionality if window is small
4. Confirm all model names visible without overlap
5. Check legend text is complete and readable
6. Verify log scale displays properly with new size

## Next Steps (Optional)
Consider:
1. Add zoom controls for charts
2. Export chart as image button
3. Full-screen chart view option
4. Responsive sizing based on window size
5. Save/load chart preferences
